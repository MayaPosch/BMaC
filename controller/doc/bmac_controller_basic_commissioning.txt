BMaC Controller

Basic commissioning test procedure
---

> Features tested:

- Basic node management using the core service & browser-based UI.
	1. Start-up of Controller process and its MQTT client & HTTP server.
	2. Connecting with browser to HTTP server (http://localhost:8080/nodes.html).
	3. Sending MQTT message with external client to MQTT broker:
		Topic: cc/config - Payload: <MAC address string> of length 6 characters.
		
	4. Refreshing unassigned nodes in browser UI, expecting to see new node appear.
	5. Assign the unassigned node, give it a location value & enable THP.
	6. Subscribe with external MQTT client to cc/<MAC address>.
	7. Save the newly assigned node configuration in the browser-based UI.
	8. Confirm reception of two MQTT messages on the cc/<MAC address> topic:
		- location ('loc;')
		- configuration ('mod;')

- Node data retention:
	1. Start by restarting the Controller process.
	2. Confirm that upon refreshing the assigned node list in the browser-based UI the node appears.
	3. Confirm reception of module configuration by external MQTT client:
		Topic: cc/config - Payload: <MAC address>
		
- Editing a node:
	1. Start the Controller process.
	2. Open the browser-based node-management UI (nodes.html).
	3. Enable the CO2 module in addition to the THP one.
	4. Save the updated configuration.
	5. Confirm the changed configuration has taken effect in the database & for the node.
	
- Deleting a node:
	1. Start the Controller process.
	2. Open the browser-based node management UI (nodes.html).
	3. Select 'delete node' option, confirm deletion in dialogue.
	4. Confirm that the node is no longer shown & not present in database.

> Notes:
	- Updating saved/unsaved state should be added to the UI.
	- JS: element.remove() is not supported in Pale Moon => add fallback.
	- New assigned node is added to top of table => attach to end instead.
	- Newly assigned node should be removed in the unassigned nodes list on the Controller.
